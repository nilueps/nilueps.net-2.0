Hi! I'm an experienced software developer with a track record of building complex and successful projects. My passion for coding began over 20 years ago creating interactive animations and generative art.\
As someone on the autistic spectrum, I excel in problem-solving skills and possess a keen eye for detail, high focus and concentration. Although I do work well in teams, I find that I need alone time to really focus and be productive.\
In my free time I'm currently pursuing self-directed studies in computer science and programming fundamentals as well as building an 8-bit computer using basic electronic components to deepen my understanding of computer architecture.
