I'm 33 and I've been depressed since my teens. I don't mean I've been in a constant state of feeling depressed during all those years, there have been ups and down. Heck, it's probably safe to say that, excluding sleep hours, I've probably spent more of that time feeling "OK" than time feeling like a flaming pile of turds. The reason I say I've been depressed since my teens, then, is that even in the periods when I'm "OK", I generally feel pretty "meh" and I generally don't get much enjoyment out of things. As I was explaining to my partner the other day, it's as though magic and wonder have disappeared from my life.

Last year I learned -- through being diagnosed with it -- that there's a medical term for this: dysthymia. From the Wikipedia [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysthymia):

> Dysthymia, also known as persistent depressive disorder (PDD), is a mood disorder consisting of the same cognitive and physical problems as depression, but with longer-lasting symptoms.

As I've mentioned before, I've only recently begun pharmacological and psychological treatment for my dysthymia. I also explained briefly some of the reasons for my reluctance to seek professional care during all these years. Maybe I'll go into that in another post, but what I want to write about now are all the different ways I tried to help myself overcome this condition. I'm not sure why, or who would care about this, but maybe it will be cathartic.

I should also mention that *none* of these helped (with some exceptions I'll note at the end). Additionally, a lot of these things are not typically regarded as being helpful for depression; some are probably more likely to make it worse. But I've been so desperate at times that I put my hopes into anything that sounded remotely helpful. It often took nothing more for me than hearing a single anecdotal account of someone somewhere claiming something made them feel somewhat better for me to think "hey, maybe *that'll* finally do it!"

**Warning**: some of the things in this list are probably bad ideas for people with mental health issues, others are probably bad ideas for anyone. Please don't treat this list as an inspiration or a recommendation in any way, shape or form. Do your research, and be safe.

So without further ado, and in no particular order, here is a list of all the things I tried in order to treat my depression:

- Diets
	+ vegetarianism
	+ veganism
	+ raw-foodism
	+ fasting
	+ intermittent fasting
	+ macrobiotics
	+ restriction diets (dairy, wheat, sweets, etc)
	+ green smoothies
- Supplements
	+ vitamin D (this one is good regardless, so I still take it daily, and you probably [should to](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/supplements-a-scorecard))
	+ "superfoods" (i.e. chia, goji berries, wheat grass)
	+ psyllium husk
	+ St-John's wort
- Drugs
	+ LSD
	+ DMT (ayahuasca)
	+ magic mushrooms
	+ cannabis
	+ MDMA
	+ salvia divinorum
	+ SSRI (citalopram)*
	+ going straightedge for a year
	+ quitting smoking
- Exercise
	+ walking
	+ running
	+ bicycling
	+ kung fu
	+ bodyweight training
	+ yoga
	+ bouldering
- Spirituality**
	+ mindfulness (The Power of Now, by E. Tolle)
	+ "spiritual autolysis" (Spiritual Enlightenment, the Damndest Thing, by J. McKenna)
	+ going on a 10 day silent retreat at a vipassana center (where they teach a type of insight meditation)
	+ "McMindfulness" apps (Headspace, 10% Happier)
	+ mantra meditation (I am that, by S. Nisargadatta Maharaj)
	+ self-hypnosis
- Relaxation techniques
- Spending time in nature
- Keeping a journal
- Automatic writing
- Dropping out of college (OK, tbh I dropped out *because* I was depressed, but I hoped it would help)
- Travelling
- Sticking to a regular sleep schedule
- Getting up early
- Sexual abstinence
- Shaving my head
- Isolating myself from others
- Talking with friends\***


\* SSRI: Of all the items in this list, this is the only one which came as a result of meeting with healthcare professionals. And while I can definitely say it hasn't cured my depression; it has helped in managing autistic meltdowns (although I hadn't been diagnosed with ASD at the time I was prescribed the medication).

\** Spirituality: Setting medical diagnoses and explanations aside for a moment, I have always felt rather strongly that at the root of my depression lay some kind of existential or spiritual crisis. I can't know if spiritual practices will ever lead to a resolution -- or if the resolution they might lead to will have any impact on my depression -- but I can't help wondering. At the end of the day, I have to admit I have always had a fascination with this profound dissatisfaction, dis-ease -- in a word, suffering; it seems to point towards something... although I have no idea what. As I mentioned elsewhere, this suffering and the desire to resolve it have endowed certain spiritual paths and practices with a very strong appeal for me. The fact that none of these practices have born fruit has made me weary and skeptical, but the primal attraction I feel has not diminished.

\*** Friends: Of everything I've listed, this is perhaps the most valuable. I can say -- without a shadow of a doubt -- that I would not be alive today if I had not had the support of close friends willing to listen to my dreary ramblings. If you suffer from depression or know someone who does, do not underestimate the value of an honest conversation. It is not a cure, but it is a solace and for this I am very thankful.
