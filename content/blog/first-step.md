About a week ago I was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Level 1 -- commonly known as 'Asperger's Syndrome'.

I'm still not sure how I feel about the diagnosis, or even if I fully agree with it. Then again, being unsure about how one feels is a common trait among those on the spectrum... Whatever the case may be, I suppose this is a step forward in figuring out what makes me tick.

It is exceedingly rare for anyone to receive *only* an ASD diagnosis. Usually, the condition comes with so called comorbidities such as ADHD, anxiety, OCD, depression, etc. In my case, the doctors determined I suffer from something called dysthymia -- aka Persistent Depressive Disorder --- which, to put it simply, means I'm somewhat sad most of the time, and very sad some of the time. It's been like this for me for the past 15-20 years; I had simply accepted this reality as an immutable part of my personality by now. To complicate things further, the psychologist who evaluated me strongly suspected I have something called 'intellectual giftedness' which is not a medical condition, but could explain some of my behavior and thought patterns. Determining that, however, would require taking an in-person IQ test and I'm really not convinced it's worthwhile.

It took me nearly twenty years to get the professional help I need. Twenty years of recurring depression, spiritual torture and suicidal despair. Twenty years of banging my head on the wall trying to figure out why I was feeling this way when everything else in my life seemed to be going well.

In that time I tried all sorts of self-help techniques: Yoga, diets, meditation, sports, drugs, you name it; nothing worked. So why was I so reluctant to seek professional help?\
I'm not entirely certain myself, but I think a big part of it has to do with internalizing certain toxic views and values such as the Protestant work ethic and notions of masculine invulnerability. (To be clear, I wasn't raised in a religious or overly patriarchal household; but I think these ideologies permeate Western society and play an important role shaping peoples inner and outer identities) Men are expected to 'bite their lip', 'take it on the chin' and 'man up' when times get tough. And as much as I loathe that kind of rhetoric, I have to recognize that it forms a substantial part of my self-image and world-view. Of course, not all men take these social expectations quite as seriously, and so the question as to why I didn't seek help remains to be fully explained.

But better late than never, right? I should add that were it not for my loving partner and their concern and insistence, I might have never taken that step.

After contacting a shrink for the first time last summer. I began taking an antidepressant (cetilopram) for the first time in October. (Not sure how much it's helped with the dysthymia, but I'm less anxious than I used to be) Now I've learned I'm autistic and have begun practical therapy aimed at learning to adapt my life to my condition --- basically, to recognize my strengths and limitations --- to try and avoid my recurring meltdowns and persistent depression. Keeping a journal is one of the first things my therapist suggested, so here I am.

I think the goal of this exercise is for me to learn to introspect and express my emotions, which is something I've always struggled with. By honing this skill, maybe it will become easier for me to relate to other people's emotional landscapes.

As always, I remain skeptical and cautious, I don't want to get my hopes up unrealistically only to have them crushed later on. I've been down that road too many times already.

So, in brief, here it is: the first post in, hopefully, an ongoing series. And if it turns out not to help, at least I'm getting some typing and writing practice; I've always admired writers ðŸ˜…
